# Introduction:

The study of ocean noise is an area of increasing importance, as the level of noise in the ocean has increased 10 to 12  decibels since the 1960s [1]. This increase is mainly attributed to the explosion in global shipping, but other sources of noise including sonar and oil exploration are likely influences. This assignment tasked students with analyzing noise caused by natural sources such as wind, rain, marine mammals, and earthquakes. We also studied the effect of airgun blasts; commonly used to search for oil deposits beneath the seabed. These acoustic profiles can be used to gauge what is 'normal' and create a baseline which future recordings can be compared to. 


# How I Did It:

Much of this assignment involved adapting a provided code file for my own analysis. I created two functions, one for calculating and plotting power spectral density, and the other for plotting a spectrogram. These functions relied on code written and provided by Professor Shima Abadi. I then retrieved data from my meteorology project to determine four combinations of weather conditions for the Oregon Offshore and the Oregon Shelf hydrophones. These conditions are rainy and windy, not rainy or windy, rainy but not windy, and windy but not rainy. This allows us to compare the effect of each weather phenomenon on ocean noise.

For the second half of the assignment I used the Ocean Observatories website to find periods of marine mammal vocalization, airgun blasts, and an earthquake. I then fed this data into the spectrogram function to plot its frequency spectrum.
